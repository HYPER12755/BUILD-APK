The first line of this file is intentionally left blank for the user to complete.  Please insert an OAuth token pair (token:token) in the first line of this file to enable OAuth authentication with Github in order to complete this configuration file.  The command 'curl' will use this information to query GitHub in open text format.  Pages https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods and https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token have information about authentication methods.

The 'build.github*.bash' scripts can stall for unauthenticated users of Github due to the high bandwith they consume when conducting multiple queries.  Enabling OAuth authentication increases the rate limit for authenticated Github users.  This link https://github.com/settings/tokens creates OAuth tokens easily.

Information about Github authentication can be viewed at this address https://developer.github.com/v3/auth/#basic-authentication at Github.  This command 'grep -C 4 -hr AUT ~/buildAPKs/scripts/' shows how the user token combination is used in the buildAPKs scripts to access the increased rate limit for authenticated Github users.

A solution for a "stash them before you merge" message after running '~/buildAPKs/update.buildAPKs.sh' is 'mv ~/buildAPKs/[file] ~/buildAPKs/stash/' to clear this message and update.  Compare the changes with 'diff ~/buildAPKs/[file] ~/buildAPKs/stash/[file]' after updating.

To clear the "Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge" message after trying to update with '~/buildAPKs/update.buildAPKs.sh' a solution is to use these shell commands:

mv ~/buildAPKs/.conf/GAUTH ~/buildAPKs/stash/GAUTH

After moving this file, run '~/buildAPKs/update.buildAPKs.sh' again.  To add the OAuth username token pair (user:token) again to the newly updated file from the stashed GAUUTH file, you can use these shell commands (hint: copy and paste):

(head -1 ~/buildAPKs/stash/GAUTH && cat ~/buildAPKs/.conf/GAUTH) > ~/buildAPKs/var/tmp/GAUTH.$$.tmp && mv ~/buildAPKs/var/tmp/GAUTH.$$.tmp ~/buildAPKs/.conf/GAUTH

This will add the OAuth token from the copied ~/buildAPKs/stash/GAUTH file to the first line of the newly updated GAUTH file.
# GAUTH EOF
